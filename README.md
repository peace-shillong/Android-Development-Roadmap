# Android-Development-Roadmap
A List of things to do when diving into android development, starting from the basics.

Are you interested in learning to develop android applications?

 Then here is a roadmap (or Checklist), where you can learn to develop apps by yourself and move forward, you start with small steps daily and move forward.

This is not a list of tutorials, codes samples or anything like that, It's simply a list of TODO List, which you can do to grow your skills 
 
 There are plenty of books, text and video tutorials and courses online, we recommend you go with Google's very own Android Development Course, but you can also check out others too.

I've divided this List into different levels starting from Level 0
